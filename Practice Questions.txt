-------------------------------------------------
Show first name of patients that start with the letter 'C'
SELECT first_name from patients WHERE first_name LIKE 'C%'

The LIKE operator in SQL is used for pattern matching in text data.
It lets you search for strings that match a specific pattern.

% (percent sign) - Matches any sequence of characters (including
                   zero characters).
_ (underscore) - Matches exactly one character.

-------------------------------------------------
Show unique birth years from patients and order them by ascending.

SELECT DISTINCT YEAR(birth_date) AS birth from patients
order by birth_date ASC

The YEAR() function extracts just the year from a date value.

-------------------------------------------------
Show unique first names from the patients table which only occurs
once in the list.

For example, if two or more people are named 'John' in the
first_name column then don't include their name in the output
list. If only 1 person is named 'Leo' then include them in
the output.

SELECT first_name
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(first_name) = 1
-------------------------------------------------
Show patient_id and first_name from patients where their
first_name start and ends with 's' and is at least 6
characters long.

SELECT
  patient_id,
  first_name
FROM patients
WHERE first_name LIKE 's____%s';

-------------------------------------------------
Display every patient's first_name.
Order the list by the length of each name and then by
alphabetically.

SELECT first_name
FROM patients
order by
  len(first_name),
  first_name;

The ORDER BY has two levels:
First: Sort by LEN(first_name) - shortest names first.

Second: Within names of the same length, sort alphabetically
        by first_name.
-------------------------------------------------
Show the total amount of male patients and the total amount of
female patients in the patients table.
Display the two results in the same row.

SELECT
(SELECT COUNT(*) from patients WHERE gender = 'male') AS male_count,
(SELECT COUNT(*) from patients WHERE gender = 'female') AS female_count;

-------------------------------------------------
Show first and last name, allergies from patients which have
allergies to either 'Penicillin' or 'Morphine'. Show results
ordered ascending by allergies then by first_name then by last_name.

SELECT first_name, last_name, allergies from patients
WHERE allergies = 'Penicillin' or allergies = 'Morphine'
order by allergies,
		     first_name,
         last_name;

-------------------------------------------------
Show all of the patients grouped into weight groups.
Show the total amount of patients in each weight group.
Order the list by the weight group decending.

For example, if they weight 100 to 109 they are placed in the
100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group, etc.

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS patients_in_group,
  FLOOR(weight / 10) * 10 AS weight_group
FROM patients
GROUP BY weight_group
ORDER BY weight_group DESC

COUNT(*) - Counts how many patients are in each weight group.
AS weight_group - Labels the calculated column for readability.
GROUP BY weight_group - Groups all patients with the same weight
                        bucket together.
ORDER BY weight_group DESC - Sorts from heaviest to lightest groups.

-------------------------------------------------
Show patient_id, weight, height, isObese from the patients table.

Display isObese as a boolean 0 or 1.

Obese is defined as weight(kg)/(height(m)2) >= 30.

weight is in units kg.

height is in units cm.

SELECT patient_id, weight, height, 
  (CASE 
    WHEN weight/(POWER(height/100.0, 2)) >= 30 THEN
      1
    ELSE
      0
    END) AS isObese
FROM patients
